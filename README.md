## Overview

`Marsha` is a video management & playback service. It is intended to be operated independently: it's like having your very own YouTube for education.

Instructors & organizations can use Marsha to upload and manage their videos (and associated files, such as subtitles or transcripts) directly from a course as they are creating it.

Once the course is published, learners simply see a video player in the course.

This seamless integration works with any LMS ([`Open edX`](https://open.edx.org), [`Moodle`](https://moodle.org), ...) thanks to the [LTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability) standard for interoperability.

Here is what `Marsha` offers out of the box:

- automatic transcoding of videos to all suitable formats from a single video file uploaded by the instructor;
- adaptive-bitrate streaming playback (both HLS and DASH);
- video access control through LTI authentication;
- accessibility through the player itself and support for subtitles, closed captions and transcripts;
- easy deployment & management of environments through `Terraform`;

## Architecture

`Marsha` is made up of 3 building blocks: a **container-native** `Django` backend, an `AWS` transcoding and file storage environment, and a `React` frontend application.

### The `Django` backend

The `Django` backend is tasked with serving the LTI pages that are integrated into the LMS. It also manages all the objects with their relationships, user accounts and all authentication concerns. It exposes a JSON API to communicate with the part of the infrastructure that operates on `AWS lambdas` and the `React` frontend.

It is defined using a [docker-compose file](../docker-compose.yml) for development, and can be deployed on any container environment (such as `Kubernetes`) for production.

### The storage & transcoding environment

Source files (video, subtitles,...) are directly uploaded to an `S3` bucket by instructors, which triggers `MediaConvert` to generate all necessary video files (various formats and fragments & manifests for adaptive-bitrate streaming) into a destination `S3` bucket. Those files are then served through the `CloudFront` CDN.

Lambdas are used to manage and monitor the process and report back to the `Django` backend.

This storage & transcoding environment requires `AWS` as it heavily relies on `AWS MediaConvert` to do the heavy lifting when it comes to transcoding. All the services it relies on are configured through `Terraform` and can be deployed effortlessly through a `make` command.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Privacy concerns**

Please note that the only objects we handle in `AWS` are the actual video and subtitles files, from upload to distribution through transcoding and storage. It is not required to deploy any database or application backend to `AWS` or to send any user's personal information there.

### The `React` frontend

The `React` frontend is responsible for the interfaces with which users interact in the LTI Iframes. It gets an authenticated token with permissions
from the view and interacts with the `Django` backend to manage objects and directly with `AWS s3` to upload files.

It also powers the same view when loaded by a learner to display a video player (thanks to [Plyr](https://plyr.io)).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Iframe management**

To have the best possible user experience for instructors, we need to be able to change the size of the `<iframe>` depending on its contents. This can be done through the [iframe-resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer) library.

`iframe-resizer` requires to run some JS inside the `<iframe>` (which we include with our `React` frontend bundle) and some JS inside the host page. It then communicates through message-passing to adjust the size of the `<iframe>`.

This means that to have the best interfaces for instructors, you need to include the host-side `iframe-resizer` JS in your LMS pages. For Open edX, this is already done in our [custom LTI consumer Xblock](https://github.com/openfun/xblock-configurable-lti-consumer).

If you cannot or do not want to include this host-side JS, you can still run `Marsha`. It will work exactly the same for learners (provided you adjust the size of the LTI `<iframe>` for video), and instructors will only have to scroll inside the `<iframe>` on some occasions.

## Getting started

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop:

```bash
$ docker -v
  Docker version 18.09.0, build 4d60db4

$ docker-compose --version
  docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01
```

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to run the following commands with `sudo` but this can be avoided by assigning your user to the `docker` group.

### The storage & transcoding environment

All tasks related to this environment are run from the `./src/aws` directory. We use `Terraform` to keep this infrastructure configuration as code and easily manage several independent deployments of the whole `AWS` infrastructure.

üîß **Before you go further**, you need to create `./src/aws/env.d/development` and replace the relevant values with your own. You can take a look at the [environment documentation](https://github.com/openfun/marsha/blob/master/docs/env.md#2-environment-to-deploy-marsha-to-aws) for more details on this topic. You can use this command to create the file from the existing model:

    $ cp ./src/aws/env.d/development.dist ./src/aws/env.d/development

Create the shared state bucket where `Terraform` will keep all the information on your deployments so different developers/machines/CI processes can interact with them:

    $ make state-create

Initialize your `Terraform` config:

    $ make init

Build the lambdas (using `yarn`) and automatically configure the infrastructure (this will start incurring billing on `AWS`):

    $ make deploy

Everything should be set up! You can check on your `AWS` management console.

You may have noticed that the `AWS` development environment requires a URL where the `Django` backend is running. You can easily get a URL that points to your locally running `Django` app using a tool such as [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com).

If you run several environments of Marsha, we suggest you take a look at [`Terraform` workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html).

### The `Django` Backend

All tasks related to the `Django` backend are run from the project root (where this `README.md` is located).

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use our `Makefile`:

    $ make bootstrap

This command builds the `app` container, installs back-end dependencies and performs database migrations. It's a good idea to use this command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or migration-related issues.

üîß **Before you go further**, you should take a look at the newly created `./env.d/development` file and replace the relevant values with your own. You can take a look at the [environment documentation](https://github.com/openfun/marsha/blob/master/docs/env.md#1-django-backend-environment) for more details on this topic.

Now that your `Docker` services are ready to be used, start the application by running:

    $ make run

You should be able to view the development view at [localhost:8060/development/](http://localhost:8060/development/).

### The `React` frontend

All tasks related to the `React` frontend are run from the `./src/frontend` directory.

We use `yarn` for all those tasks. Make sure you have a recent version installed:

```bash
$ yarn --version
  1.13.0
```

If you need to install `yarn`, please take a look at [the official documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Install all the dependencies:

    $ yarn install

Run the build and copy the `iframe-resizer` host-side JS into your local `Django` assets:

    $ yarn build
    $ yarn copy-iframe-resizer

üóù **Before you go further**, you need to create a `Consumer Site` and `Passport` in Marsha's [admin panel](http://localhost:8060/admin/).

You should be all set to make the LTI request on the [development view](http://localhost:8060/development/) and access `Marsha`'s frontend interface!
