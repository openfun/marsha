            ["starts-with", "$success_action_redirect", ""]
        ]
        Conditions that are included may pertain to acl, content-length-range, Cache-Control,
        Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, Expires, success_action_redirect,
        redirect, success_action_status, and/or x-amz-meta-.
        Note that if you include a condition, you must specify the a valid value in the fields

        as well.

        Key name, optionally add ${filename} to the end to attach the submitted filename.
        Note that key related conditions and fields are filled out for you and should not be
