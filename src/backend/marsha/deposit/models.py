            Passing a value for this argument will return the source S3 key for the deposited file

            upload policy for this prospective version of the track, so that the client can

        extension: Type[string]
            The extension used by the uploaded media. This extension is added at the end of the key
            to keep a record of the extension. We will use it in the update-state endpoint to
            record it in the database.
