# Translations

Translations are managed on crowdin: [https://crowdin.com/project/marsha](https://crowdin.com/project/marsha)

Feel free to help us to translate Marsha.
If you want to translate the project in a new language ask us in an issue and we will be happy to add it.

## Release Process

We choose to commit, before each release, all the translations.
We made everything to ease this step by creating tasks in the Makefile.

Before using the command available in the Makefile, you need to set the environment
variables `CROWDIN_API_KEY`, `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_BASE_PATH`. See the
`Environment variables` documentation.

You only have to run:

```bash
$ make i18n-download-and-compile
```

And then commit the changes in your PR preparing a new release.
