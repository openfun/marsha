# Permissions

`marsha` user access and permissions are managed following two different approaches:

- For the LTI part, the authentication and authorization are managed by the LTI consumer site.
  The LTI consumer site is responsible for authenticating the user and determining
  their `role`. The user ID and Role are then passed to `marsha` through the LTI
  request.
- For the standalone site, the authentication and authorization are managed by `marsha`.
  `marsha` can also rely on external SSO (see [renater_federation_saml.md](renater_federation_saml.md)).


## LTI

### Authentication

The user is authenticated by the LTI consumer site, and `marsha` relies on the data provided by the signed LTI request.
Once the first LTI request has been received, `marsha` will provide a pair of access/refresh JWT for the frontend 
to authenticate requests.
These JWT contains the authentication/authorization information provided by the original LTI request.

### Authorization

The user's `role` is provided by the LTI consumer site, and `marsha` relies on the data provided by the signed LTI request.


## Standalone site

### Authentication

The user is authenticated by `marsha` and can be either:

- an "internal" Django user (_i.e._ a user created and managed by `marsha` itself, 
  but for now there is no registration process for external users to use this).
- a user authenticated by an external SSO (see [renater_federation_saml.md](renater_federation_saml.md))

The frontend application provides the login page, the backend will handle the authentication process and 
generate a pair of access/refresh JWT for the frontend to make requests.
These JWT only contains the authentication information (user ID).

### Authorization

Authorizations are built around several models:

- `OrganizationAccess` links a user to an organization and a role for this organization.
- `ConsumerSiteAccess` links a user to a consumer site and a role for this consumer site.
- `PlaylistAccess` links a user to a playlist and a role for this playlist.

For each one, a user can only have one role (_.e.g._ only one link between a user and a playlist).

- `ADMIN`: the user is an administrator of the playlist.
